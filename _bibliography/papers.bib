  abstract={Listeners use short interjections, so-called backchannels, to signify attention or express agreement. The automatic analysis of this behavior is of key importance for human conversation analysis and interactive conversational agents. Current state-of-the-art approaches for backchannel analysis from visual behavior make use of two types of features: features based on body pose and features based on facial behavior. At the same time, transformer neural networks have been established as an effective means to fuse input from different data sources, but they have not yet been applied to backchannel analysis. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multi-modal transformer architectures for automatic backchannel analysis based on pose and facial information. We address both the detection of backchannels as well as the task of estimating the agreement expressed in a backchannel. In evaluations on the MultiMediate'22 backchannel detection challenge, we reach 66.4% accuracy with a one-layer transformer architecture, outperforming the previous state of the art. With a two-layer transformer architecture, we furthermore set a new state of the art (0.0604 MSE) on the task of estimating the amount of agreement expressed in a backchannel.},

  abstract={In this paper, we use techniques of enumerative combinatorics to study the following problem: we count the number of ways to split $n$ balls into nonempty, ordered bins so that the most crowded bin has exactly $k$ balls. We find closed forms for three of the different cases that can arise: $k>\frac{n}{2}, k=\frac{n}{2}$, and when there exists $j<k$ such that $n=2 k+j$. As an immediate result of our proofs, we find a closed form for the number of positive integer solutions to $x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_{\ell}=n$ with the maximum of $\left\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{\ell}\right\}$ being equal to $k$, when $n$ and $k$ have one of the aforementioned algebraic relationships. The problem is generalized to find a formula that enumerates the total number of ways without specific conditions on $n, \ell, k$. Subsequently, various additional identities and estimates related to this enumeration are proven and interpreted.},
