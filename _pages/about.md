I am a master thesis student at Mercedes-Benz AG in the Pattern Recognition team. My master's thesis research topic is **Controllable Generation of OOD scenarios in Autonomous Driving**. I'm enrolled in MSc. Data Science and AI at Universit√§t des Saarlandes [Graduating in **May 2024**]. I carry more than **2 years of work experience** at academic and profesisonal institutions researching, developing and shipping AI based solutions.

My previous experiences include working at Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft in the [MatBeyoNDT](https://www.izfp.fraunhofer.de/en/technologien/forschungs--und-leistungszentren/MatBeyoNDT.html) team to develop Vision and Speech-based systems for precision lifestock monitoring. I have also worked at German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) in the [Neuro-Mechanistic Modelling](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/neuro-mechanistic-modeling) group to create custom multi-agent Reinforcement Learning environments and train Deep RL models.
